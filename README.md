# SCT_ML_4
# 🖐 Hand Gesture Recognition (CNN)

This project is a **Hand Gesture Recognition system** using **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)**.  
It can classify multiple hand gestures from images, enabling intuitive human-computer interaction and gesture-based control systems.

## 🌟 Features

- Uses **CNN** for automatic feature extraction and classification
- Supports multiple gestures (palm, index, fist, thumbs up, ok)
- Lightweight and can be trained on a small dataset
- Interactive **Streamlit app** for testing gestures in real-time
- Provides confidence scores for each prediction
